This repository collects the processed data that we used for all the figures in the paper [Immigrant Key Workers: Their Contribution to Europe's COVID-19 Response](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3584941) and the exact list of key occupations that we apply in the paper with ISCO-08 coding at 3 digits.

The files are in the [data](data/) folder. File names reflect the figures numbering in the paper. The file `kw_isco3d` contains our exact definition of key occupations.

The original micro data are taken from the restricted EU-LFS (2018) and cannot be shared.
